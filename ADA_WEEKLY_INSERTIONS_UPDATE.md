---

## 🎯 Changes Summary

### A) Chart Fixes ✅

**Issue:** Chart was blank/not rendering properly

**Solutions Implemented:**

1. **Chart.js Loading Verification**
   - Added check: `if (typeof Chart === 'undefined')`
   - Chart.js already loaded in `<head>` via CDN (line 18)
   - No loading order issues

2. **Fixed Canvas Height**
   - Changed from: `height: 220px;`
   - Changed to: `height: clamp(220px, 28vh, 320px);`
   - Responsive height that adapts to viewport

3. **Proper Initialization**
   - Uses `DOMContentLoaded` event to ensure canvas exists
   - Stores chart instance globally: `let adaChartInstance = null;`
   - Separates initialization (`initADAChart()`) from updates (`updateADAChart()`)

4. **Non-empty Data Arrays**
   - Chart initialized with empty arrays `[]`
   - Populated immediately by `calculateADA()` on page load
   - Arrays populated with equal-length month-by-month data

5. **Two Datasets with Proper Styling**
   - **Subscribers Dataset:**
     - Solid line (`borderDash: []`)
     - Red/coral color (`#FF6B57`)
     - Left Y-axis (`yAxisID: 'y'`)
     - Filled area under curve
   - **Cumulative Effective CPM Dataset:**
     - **Dashed line** (`borderDash: [8, 4]`)
     - Gold color (`#F7C948`)
     - Right Y-axis (`yAxisID: 'y1'`)
     - No fill

6. **"Simulated" Pill**
   - Already present in HTML (line 1114)
   - Styled with gray badge

7. **Respects Reduced Motion**
   - Animation duration: `0` if `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce`
   - Chart updates: `'none'` mode if reduced motion preferred

### B) Calculator Math - Weekly Insertions ✅

**Updated Logic:**

**New Input Added:**
- **Open Rate (%)** - Default: 62%
  - Min: 1, Max: 100
  - Affects impression calculations
  - Located between "Expected Growth" and "Monthly Rate"

**Core Assumptions:**
```javascript
const INSERTIONS_PER_MONTH = 4; // Weekly insertions (1 per week)
```

**Per-Month Calculations:**
```javascript
// Audience for month m (1-indexed)
subs_m = startingAudience + (monthlyGrowth × (m - 1))

// Impressions for month m
impr_m = subs_m × (openRate / 100) × 4
```

**Campaign Totals:**
```javascript
// Sum across all months
total_impressions = Σ impr_m

// Average of monthly audiences
avg_audience = (Σ subs_m) / campaignLength

// Total spend
total_cost = monthlyRate × campaignLength
```

**CPM Calculations:**
```javascript
// Effective CPM across entire campaign
effective_cpm = (total_cost / total_impressions) × 1000

// Month 1 baseline CPM
cpm_month1 = (monthlyRate / impr_1) × 1000

// Savings percentage (floored at 0%)
savings = max(0, ((cpm_month1 - effective_cpm) / cpm_month1) × 100)
```

**Example Calculation (Defaults):**
- **Inputs:**
  - Campaign Length: 3 months
  - Starting Audience: 20,000
  - Monthly Growth: 6,000
  - Open Rate: 62%
  - Monthly Rate: $900

- **Month-by-Month:**
  - **Month 1:** 20,000 subs → 49,600 impressions (20K × 62% × 4)
  - **Month 2:** 26,000 subs → 64,480 impressions (26K × 62% × 4)
  - **Month 3:** 32,000 subs → 79,360 impressions (32K × 62% × 4)

- **Outputs:**
  - Avg Audience: **26,000**
  - Total Impressions: **193,440**
  - Effective CPM: **$13.95**
  - Month 1 CPM: **$18.15**
  - Savings: **+23.1%**

---

### C) Copy Updates ✅

**Explainer Text (Left Column):**

**Before:**
> "When you book a monthly or seasonal package while we're growing, your spend is fixed—but our audience isn't. As readership rises, your effective CPM and cost-per-click trend down."

**After:**
> "Book monthly or seasonal packages now and your rate stays the same while readership grows. Because we run **one sponsor insertion per week (≈4 / 12 / 24 sends)**, your total impressions rise each month, pushing your effective CPM down over time."

**Key Changes:**
- Explicitly mentions "one sponsor insertion per week"
- Shows send counts: 4 (1mo), 12 (3mo), 24 (6mo)
- More direct language about CPM decrease mechanism

**Note Added Below Calculator:**
```
"Modeled on one sponsor insertion per week. Change Open Rate or Growth to see impact."
```
- Small gray text (text-xs)
- Positioned above disclaimer
- Encourages experimentation with inputs

---

### D) Chart Data - Dynamic Updates ✅

**Chart Now Driven by Calculator:**

**Before:** Static simulated data hardcoded
```javascript
const subscribersData = [20000, 26000, 32000, ...];
const cpmData = [45, 34.6, 28.1, ...];
```

**After:** Dynamic data from calculator inputs
```javascript
// Generated in calculateADA() function
const chartLabels = monthlyData.map(m => `Month ${m.month}`);
const chartSubscribers = monthlyData.map(m => m.subscribers);
const chartCPM = monthlyData.map(m => m.cumulativeCPM);

updateADAChart(chartLabels, chartSubscribers, chartCPM);
```

**Cumulative Effective CPM:**
- Shows CPM **trending down** over time
- Calculated as: `(total_cost_to_date / total_impressions_to_date) × 1000`
- Demonstrates the value of locking in early

**X-Axis Labels:**
- Dynamic based on campaign length
- 1 month: "Month 1"
- 3 months: "Month 1", "Month 2", "Month 3"
- 6 months: "Month 1" through "Month 6"

**Legend Updated:**
- Solid line indicator for Subscribers
- Dashed line indicator for Cumulative CPM
- Smaller text (text-xs) for compactness

---

### E) UX Polish ✅

**1. Live Recalculation**
- All inputs have `onchange="calculateADA()"`
- Chart updates instantly when any input changes
- Outputs update in real-time

**2. Animated Updates**
- Chart transitions smoothly between states

- **ARIA Live Regions:** Outputs have `aria-live="polite"`
  - Screen readers announce value changes
  - Non-intrusive announcements
- **Keyboard Accessible:** All form controls tabbable
- **Focus States:** Visible focus rings on inputs

**4. Input Validation**
- Open Rate: `min="1"` and `max="100"`
- All number inputs have type validation
- Calculator handles edge cases gracefully

**5. Formatted Output**
- Thousands separators: `toLocaleString()`
- Currency formatting: `'$' + value.toFixed(2)`
- Percentage with sign: `'+23.1%'` or `'0.0%'`
- Impressions rounded to whole numbers

**6. Code Comments**
- Extensive documentation in JavaScript
- Formula explanations at function level
- Inline comments for complex calculations
- Easy to adjust parameters in the future

## 📈 Formula Verification

### Example Walkthrough (3-month campaign)

**Given:**
- Starting Audience: 20,000
- Growth: 6,000/month
- Open Rate: 62%
- Rate: $900/month
- Insertions: 4/month

**Month 1:**
```
Subscribers: 20,000 + (6,000 × 0) = 20,000
Impressions: 20,000 × 0.62 × 4 = 49,600
Cost to date: $900
Cumulative Impressions: 49,600
Cumulative CPM: ($900 / 49,600) × 1000 = $18.15
```

**Month 2:**
```
Subscribers: 20,000 + (6,000 × 1) = 26,000
Impressions: 26,000 × 0.62 × 4 = 64,480
Cost to date: $1,800
Cumulative Impressions: 49,600 + 64,480 = 114,080
Cumulative CPM: ($1,800 / 114,080) × 1000 = $15.78
```

**Month 3:**
```
Subscribers: 20,000 + (6,000 × 2) = 32,000
Impressions: 32,000 × 0.62 × 4 = 79,360
Cost to date: $2,700
Cumulative Impressions: 114,080 + 79,360 = 193,440
Cumulative CPM: ($2,700 / 193,440) × 1000 = $13.95
```

**Campaign Summary:**
```
Avg Audience: (20,000 + 26,000 + 32,000) / 3 = 26,000
Total Impressions: 193,440
Effective CPM: $13.95
Month 1 CPM: $18.15
Savings: ((18.15 - 13.95) / 18.15) × 100 = 23.1%
```

**✅ All calculations verified!**
